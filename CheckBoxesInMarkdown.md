# Checkboxes in markdown

I found [this link](https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-checkbox-github/), I think it might be helpful in future!!

**Syntax for check box in markdown:**

_add a hyphen first then start the line with [] or [x], space should be added before and after square brackets followed by content._

Example:

- [x] Intro
- [] Structure
- [] Chapters
- [] Conclusion
